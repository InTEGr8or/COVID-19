*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX)
*   Summary: HR 838 would permit levels of espionage against the American people not seen since the introduction of the Patriot Act.

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Pres. Trump
*   Summary: In response to the recent tragic events in Gilroy, El Paso, and Dayton, President Trump has called for Congress to pass “red flag” legislation. Red flag laws stand for the proposition that gun owners can have their rights and property taken from them – by force – on the basis of allegations without the government having even reasonable suspicion, let alone probable cause or constitutionally sufficient adjudication.

**Bill/Issue: Trump's Possible Ban on Suppressors**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Pres. Trump
*   Summary: Pres. Trump says he is “seriously” considering a ban on suppressors. What the President is doing to the Second Amendment is nothing short of “Death by a thousand cuts”.

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Bass (D-CA-37)
*   Summary:REPUBLICAN backed HR 1585, aka the “Violence Against Women Act” (VAWA), is a front for expanding extremely harmful gun regulations. HR 1585 includes legislation for ex-parte gun confiscation, lifetime gun bans for misdemeanor charges, and would fund the CDC to do biased research on “Gun Violence”. HR 1585 now moves over for a Senate vote, a Senate whose moral backbone is in question when it comes to protecting the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights.

**Bill/Issue: HR 1115 - Permits Stronger Safety Standards for Firearms**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Kelly (D-IL-2)
*   Summary:HR 1115 would allow firearms to be regulated as consumer products and thus susceptible to stricter safety standards. Stricter safety standards will allow for government to force firearms companies to stop production of perfectly acceptable and safe firearms.

*   Author: Rep. Kelly (D-IL-2)

*   Author: Rep. Collins (R-NY-27)
*   Summary: HR 1072 would require state and local penalties/taxes on long guns or their parts to an amount to less than that of the federal government’s current taxes or penalties. In addition, HR 1072 would grant a prevailing lawsuit against excessive state fines or penalties a “reasonable attorney's fee”.

*   Position: Support
*   Author: Sen. Cassidy (R-LA)

**Bill/Issue: HR 157 - Make Firearm Manufacturers Responsible for 3rd Party Actions**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Evans (D-PA-2)
*   Summary: HR 157 would make it so that firearms manufacturers can be held responsible in state or federal civil court for the actions of the people who use their firearms. This bill will leave many gun manufacturers vulnerable to anti-gun organizations & their frivolous lawsuits and potentially cause the manufacturers to shut down.

**Bill/Issue: HR 282 - Federal Gun Ban Omnibus Bill**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Beatty (D-OH-3)
*   Summary: HR 282 covers the whole gamut of “problems” anti-gunners have with the Second Amendment. HR 282 would seek to prevent the sale or possession of most semi-automatic firearms and outright bans All AK and AR “types”, require disclosing lost or stolen firearms, mandatory gun show background checks, and the restriction or outright banning of firearms parts and accessories. HR 282 will bring about a Second Amendment crisis if allowed to pass.

**Bill/Issue: S 184 - Funding for Biased Gun Violence Research by the CDC**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Sen. Markey (D-MA)
*   Summary: S 184 would appropriate $250,000,000 over the course of 5 years in order for the CDC to conduct research on gun violence prevention. S 184 is creates a perfect storm for the CDC to find confirmation that guns are the problem and give a solution of gun confiscation.

**Bill/Issue: HR 820 - Closes the “Gun Show Loophole”**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Maloney (D-NY-12)
*   Summary: HR 820 would prohibit all private firearms transfers at gun shows. By calling this a loophole, Rep. Maloney is implying that somehow law-abiding gun owners are getting “around the law.” In reality, they are following the law. And one more law isn’t going to do anything except to further trample the rights of all Americans.

**Bill/Issue: HR 1266 - Considers Firearms Parts to Count as Firearms**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Espaillat (D-NY-13)
*   Summary: HR 1266 would treat any part that can be assembled into a firearm or can turn any device into a firearm as a firearm under the law. Labeled the “Ghost Guns are Real Guns” bill, HR 1266 is Rep. Espaillat’s feeble attempt to “do something”. What HR 1266 will really do is cause lawful gun owners more pain when it comes to transporting parts, manufacturing their own firearms, and storing firearm parts.

**Bill/Issue: HR 1279 - Promotion of Gun Buyback Programs**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Payne (D-NJ-10)
*   Summary: HR 1279 would set aside funding for State, local, or private gun buyback programs. This bill uses taxpayer dollars in order to bribe gun owners to give up their 2A rights.

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Deutch (D-FL-22)
*   Summary: HR 1186 would ban all magazines that hold a capacity of more than 10 rounds. This will only punish law-abiding gun owners and hinder their right to self-defense.

**Bill/Issue: HR 1263 - Semi-Automatic Rifles as NFA Items**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Deutch (D-FL-22)
*   Summary: HR 1263 is yet another piece of the anti-gun House Democrat plan to destroy the Second Amendment. HR 1263 would classify any semi-automatic rifle capable of accepting a detachable magazine as an item to be regulated by the NFA. If this bill were to pass, buying a common AR would require a $200 tax stamp and an incredibly long waiting period. It would require the registration of these firearms with the government and essentially ban common transfers without going through the NFA process. Bottom line: This bill will eviscerate the Second Amendment.

**Bill/Issue: HR 8 - Forces Background Checks on All Firearm Sales**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Thompson (D-CA)
*   Summary: This bill will mandate that background checks be completed for ALL firearm purchases. It would allow some limited exemptions, such as borrowing a gun for hunting, but NOT for the constitutionally protected right to self-defense.

**Bill/Issue: HR 167 - Mandatory Licensed Dealer for Transfers at Gun Show**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Green (D-TX-9)
*   Summary: HR 167 would mandate that all firearms transactions at a gun show be processed through a licensed firearms dealer and failure to do so would result in a minimum $10,000 and/or 1-2 years in prison. This bill would also empower the government to track every firearm you buy or sell and punish otherwise responsible gun owners.
* [ ]   Take Action: [Link](https://www.firearmspolicy.org/hr-167)

**Bill/Issue: HR 1297 - Classifying AR Pistols/Others as NFA Firearms**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Demings (D-FL-10)
*   Summary: HR 1297, The Law Enforcement Protection Act,would add armor-piercing, concealable weapons as a category under the National Firearms Act (NFA). Presumably, Rep. Demings is targeting AR/AK pistols and other guns like the FN Five-seveN that fire “high-powered” rounds. Demings states that “If the handguns addressed by LEPA were designed to be fired from the shoulder, they would be considered a short-barreled rifle, subjecting them to NFA regulation. They fire the same rifle rounds, but because they are designed to be fired from the hand, they escape NFA regulation.”
*   But the reality is, Demings is not trying to address a loophole. She is just trying to ban guns that are used to protect everyday gun owners across America. This bill must be stopped!

**Bill/Issue: HR 1112 - Extended Time Limits on FBI Background Checks**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Clyburn (D-SC-6)
*   Summary: Under current Federal guidelines, FFLs can transfer a gun immediately after receiving a “proceed” authorization through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. In cases where the FBI gives a “delay,” it is up to the dealer whether to go through with the transfer after three business days. HR 1112 would remove that discretion and instead impose a delay of potentially 20 business days before the transaction could go through. There is no reason that the Second Amendment should be held up at the whim of a bureaucrat in Washington D.C.

**Bill/Issue: Federal "High Capacity" Magazine Ban**

*   Position: Opposed
*   Summary: THIS BILL WILL HURT YOUR RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. By limiting your magazine capacity to a completely arbitrary amount of 10 rounds, Rep. Deutch & Sen. Menendez are cutting you at the achilles in your ability to be prepared for any and all threats you as a law-abiding gun owner may face. The "Keep Americans Safe Act" will do is leave lawful people who only wish to protect themselves the best they can from being able to do so.

*   Position: Opposed
*   Author: Rep. Watson Coleman (D-NJ)

*   Position: Opposed
