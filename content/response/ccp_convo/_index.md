title: My Conversation With a CCP Member

In February I became involved in a conversation with a man claiming to be a CCP member and college professor in Henan Province.

I had been louldly criticizing the CCP on Twitter and this person disagreed, but then contacted me through DM to express doubts in The Party.

"There is something I can’t understand. After Wuhan and China risking so many people’s life, why people in the other country can’t take the lessons."

This is hard for me, and many here, to understand also.

It is actually a fascinating lesson, one which we can both learn from.

Some statements which have cultural currency here are "most people survive", and "many have no symptoms", and "it only affects the old", and "I'm sure the authorities are doing the best thing".

A disturbing policy statement that has come out of the U.K. government in the past couple of days is "we need to develop herd-immunity." This is a dangerous intention. Herd immunity develops without any human intervention AFTER the pandemic has swept through and killed many. It only develops after about 80% infection. There is no need for any human to intend to develop herd immunity, and the only human action that can help develop herd immunity is to promote spread, or to relax prevention measures, such as prophylaxis.

Government academics can play with whole populations like this. They can treat us like forests and say "maybe we should let the fire burn through and clean out the underbrush of useless eaters and mouths-to-feed". They are having a "measles party" with our lives.

This is a tendency of ALL POLITICIANS, but it is a tendency WHICH IS PROMOTED by communist collectivism. We have that way of thinking here too. In collectivism we think that everyone in the collective thinks one way, and outside of the collective people think a different way. Your party uses the language of "in the interests of the party" as if everyone in The Party has the same interest. I am versed in this tradition. I know it well. We have it here too. It is WRONG.

After failing to combat the virus by hiding it, The Party turns to private individuals for help. Self-quarantine, self-masking, self-isolation, self-hygiene turn out to be the best solutions. Even those who get sick are asked to stay home and take care of themselves as long as possible to avoid overburdening the public system. In South Korea they have drive-through clinics for PRIVATE automobiles, not public transportation.

In England the Healthcare Worker's Union representative, which is one of the most socialistic institutions in the country, said that at first they were being asked to "sacrifice themselves for the national cause" but then they started running short of healthcare workers. At that point the leader OF THE UNION had to do a 180° reversal and adopt the most individualistic stance possible, and that the collectivist Union had always fought against. He said, "You know I guess it's like that thing they always say, in the airplane when the masks drop down you have to PUT ON YOUR OWN MASK FIRST before putting on other's". That is a total abdication of the PRINCIPLE of collectivism.

But the collectivist has a short memory and has a friendly relationship with contradictions. The call them "paradoxes", and treat them as inexplicable. I have no doubt that Union leader will return to demanding "sacrifice", it is human sacrifice that we are talking about, from his members and others, probably within the same hour.

At this point I must confess my ignorance of the CCP operations. Do you have to qualify? How do you join? How many members are there. I speak to you as a distant observer and I am not making any personal assumptions about you.

I find it more interesting that you are an accountant, or professor of accounting. I am a computer programmer. Do you know that accounting, and business processes, have always been the primary driver of computer development? The accountant connects real-world conditions and events to abstract numbers. Did I say that correctly? Is that true? Do you understand what I mean? It is, what you do, a matter of profound importance.

I could keep talking much more but have spoken too long. Good day, sir.
