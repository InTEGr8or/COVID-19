                  the virus mutates then to the Latin call CDC my name is brian hammond brian is an ecologist for the CDC specializing in infectious diseases today I&rsquo;m breaking down clips from movies and television about pandemics I&rsquo;d like to go on record that I love all these movies I don&rsquo;t want to come across as I&rsquo;m not a fan because I am small-town outbreak from the movie outbreak this one has so many flaws you see people shaking hands and that doesn&rsquo;t occur in an outbreak area if there is some kind of a greeting it&rsquo;s usually elbow to elbow the PPE personal protective equipment is is reasonably accurate we don&rsquo;t go into a place wearing helmets and hazmat suits like that but the peppers air purifying respirators that they have on their waists are our peppers that we have used in the past and the whole point of the powered air is that you have positive pressure inside the head cover it&rsquo;s pushing air out and nothing can come in they go from this right here with a full hazmat suit and a helmet two guys with surgical masks you notice that she&rsquo;s not wearing any eye protection and the guy directly behind her is so one of the little details that if this were truly a fever virus outbreak and this was an isolation ward they would all have a face shield or eye protection some gloves not some others without gloves it&rsquo;s total chaos it&rsquo;s a mess that&rsquo;s pure Hollywood fiction apparently they all go to the movies here smallpox er when do the rashes are three days ago [Music] follow me quickly what is it it&rsquo;s just a precaution excuse me coming through here suitcases smallpox oh my god dunt dunt done this is a tad on the far-fetched side because smallpox was eradicated in 1980 if a vaccine for now the CDC should have a stockpile of all the smallpox that exists in the world are in freezers in really secure labs smallpox has been eradicated I heard the Russians had some on ice if a terrorist group got old and for this to actually have happened there would have to have been some kind of a very very serious breach in security damn I should have called in sick day we&rsquo;re gonna look at a couple of scenes from contagion and here&rsquo;s where they explain the spread of the virus here is a model of the virus and how it attaches to its host the blue is virus and the gold is human and the red is the viral attachment protein and the green is its receptor in the human cells it is available this computer software isn&rsquo;t is able to form sort of a three-dimensional image of the virus itself and they can identify through sequencing which parts of the virus are the receptors where it binds to the human cell which parts are coding for certain proteins that cause illness or replication and we&rsquo;ve sequenced the virus and determined its origin and we&rsquo;ve modelled the way it enters the cells of the lung in the brain very accurate in terms of being able to pinpoint certain areas of the genome that will have certain effects on the human or on the virus or even the cell that it&rsquo;s affecting the virus contains both bat and pig sequences in the bottom right and here you can see the crossover event that pig back yeah I haven&rsquo;t heard the term crossover when the virus leaves the host and enters an organism that&rsquo;s not a host it&rsquo;s called spillover as the spillover events occur and with the multiple times this virus is replicating they&rsquo;re looking at these mutations as this thing has been going along that&rsquo;s actually something they can do animals spreading disease contagion very accurate especially the not hand-washing thing there was an in bowl of rest and outbreak in the Philippines at a pig farm we now have evidence that bats are our possible hosts for resting virus flu to the pig farm and then it was found in the pigs in a sample that was shipped to plum island outbreak has a ton of problems let&rsquo;s take a look at the scene with the monkey monkey deserves an Oscar I don&rsquo;t know where to begin what can I talk about the fact that that&rsquo;s the South American monkey that they caught in Africa well it&rsquo;s something at least maybe it&rsquo;s enough part of my job at the CDC is to catch animals take samples and test them for viruses the monkey is a capuchin monkey not found in Africa it would be some other green monkey like a vervet or something else like that we wouldn&rsquo;t use a live person as bait let alone a child we actually study reservoir ecology know their habits know their habitat and know how to catch them you know a monkey could technically bite someone and have virus in the saliva but generally speaking they&rsquo;re so sick and they just kind of lay there and die in contagion they really got it right here they did not virus choosing the host World War Z he&rsquo;s infecting himself with another pathogen in hopes that this zombie would pass him by or the virus in the zombie would pass him by I like the idea it gets to essentially the goal of a virus it wants to find a host that it can continue to replicate its genetic material indefinitely that&rsquo;s not the question we&rsquo;re really asking is it it&rsquo;s fiction of course because a virus isn&rsquo;t going to smell if a guy sick be able to tell if this guy has cancer and therefore I don&rsquo;t want to infect that it can&rsquo;t choose global pandemic and dawn of the Planet of the Apes source of the virus was traced back to drug testing done at Genesis laboratories in San Francisco location showing signs of what&rsquo;s being dubbed the simian field CDC is projecting a fatality toll ranging from 5 million to a 150 million in the next six to eight theoretically that&rsquo;s how things will happen those red lines look kind of like you know air air travel pathways and then having interactions with individuals within an airport you can&rsquo;t avoid some type of personal space invasion it&rsquo;s a very plausible scenario now known as patient zero was accidentally exposed to retrovirus 8lz 113 in this clip they say patient zero and that&rsquo;s not something that we typically use in my field we tend to use what we call an index patient the individual that has first been identified to have whatever virus it is or disease caused by whatever virus it is this clip is about virus mutation from the television show house an infant picks up a regular old measles virus it&rsquo;s a rash it&rsquo;s extremely uncomfortable as a wicked fever but he lives well the animation is not extremely accurate why do people lie to me because the measles virus is an RNA virus and that&rsquo;s a piece of DNA can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs once every million or so times the virus mutates this explosion is not accurate again why are we getting hung up on what I did what happens is just sort of an error in the copying of the nucleotide bases instead of Dan having a fever and a rash the virus travels to his brain and hides for 16 years some acute sclerosing pain encephalitis daus&rsquo;s disease is an actual disease and it is basic sort of a leftover from having a measles virus infection so that that part is true it&rsquo;s a sick brain zombie infection the walking dead by scan forward to the first event scanning to first event there&rsquo;s no artificial intelligence at the CDC there are auditoriums at the CDC but they don&rsquo;t look like this the brain goes into shutdown then the major organs it invades the brain like meningitis meningitis is more the condition when here they&rsquo;re making it seem like it&rsquo;s some sort of a pathogen scan to the second event I&rsquo;ve never used the word event just shell driven by mindless instant in severe accidents I would imagine that that&rsquo;s possibility I think technically you&rsquo;d probably be declared brain dead that there&rsquo;d be some electrical activity there I don&rsquo;t think you could see it like that what was that this looks like pure CGI to me we protected the public from very nasty infection in the hospital in the movie outbreak dr.
